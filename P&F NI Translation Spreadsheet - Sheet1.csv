STR_SLIDERS_FERB_START,,,,,,,Starting a new theory course. All information is strictly confidential.
STR_SLIDERS_FERB_END,,,,,,,Theory course complete.
STR_SLIDERS_1_01_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Hey, Ferb, should we start building the world's coolest rollercoaster?"
STR_SLIDERS_1_01_FERB_1,,,,,,,"You know me, I'm a man of action. But we need a scientific approach."
STR_SLIDERS_1_01_PHINEAS_2,,,,,,,"Of course, a scientific approach is our speciality!"
STR_SLIDERS_1_02_FERB_1,,,,,,,"We have to use parts of different sizes, so that the track will turn out really cool."
STR_SLIDERS_1_02_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Definitely! Our coaster will be the tallest, longest, and coolest in the world! Hey, what do you mean by ""size""?"
STR_SLIDERS_1_02_FERB_2,,,,,,,"Here, I'll explain."
STR_SLIDERS_1_03_FERB_1,,,,,,,Everything has a length.
STR_SLIDERS_1_03_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,Look! That top box is twice as lnog as Perry! Great measurement tool!
STR_SLIDERS_1_03_FERB_2,,,,,,,An object may be shorter or longer than others.
STR_SLIDERS_1_04_FERB_1,,,,,,,Everything has a height.
STR_SLIDERS_1_04_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Great! If I stood on your shoulders, we would be twice as high!"
STR_SLIDERS_1_04_FERB_2,,,,,,,"An object may be lower, higher, or the same height as another."
STR_SLIDERS_1_05_FERB_1,,,,,,,Everything has a width.
STR_SLIDERS_1_05_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"I know width is also called thickness. For example, a thick book."
STR_SLIDERS_1_05_FERB_2,,,,,,,An object may be narrower or wider or the same width as another object.
STR_SLIDERS_1_06_FERB_1,,,,,,,"The length, width, and height define the dimensions of an object."
STR_SLIDERS_1_06_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,All cars of the same model have the same dimensions and are therefore the same size.
STR_SLIDERS_1_06_FERB_2,,,,,,,"An object may be larger, smaller, or the same size as another."
STR_SLIDERS_1_07_FERB_1,,,,,,,And the platypus is the only way to measure the dimensions of objects?
STR_SLIDERS_1_07_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Of course not! Length, width, and height can be measured with a ruler, which is divided up into pieces called centimeters."
STR_SLIDERS_1_07_PHINEAS_2,,,,,,,You can put the ruler next to the subject and see how many centimeters fit in it.
STR_SLIDERS_1_08_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Ferb, you messed up the drawing again! The trash is already full!"
STR_SLIDERS_1_08_FERB_1,,,,,,,This is because it has a small volume...
STR_SLIDERS_1_08_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Mom said that I'm in charge! And I have my eyes on you...
STR_SLIDERS_1_08_PHINEAS_2,,,,,,,"Sure thing, sis..."
STR_SLIDERS_1_08_PHINEAS_3,,,,,,,"And what is ""volume""?"
STR_SLIDERS_1_08_FERB_2,,,,,,,Let's try to understand.
STR_SLIDERS_1_09_FERB_1,,,,,,,"The volume of one object may be smaller, larger, or the same as another."
STR_SLIDERS_1_09_FERB_2,,,,,,,"Volume is the space occupied by an object. The longer, taller, and wider the object is, the greater its volume, and the more space it takes up."
STR_SLIDERS_1_10_FERB_1,,,,,,,"To measure the volume of these two boxes, we can put same-sized cubes in them."
STR_SLIDERS_1_10_FERB_2,,,,,,,"The first box fit eight blocks, and the second only fit six."
STR_SLIDERS_1_10_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,That means the volume of the first box is greater than that of the second!
STR_SLIDERS_1_11_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,And what if we don't have those cubes?
STR_SLIDERS_1_11_FERB_1,,,,,,,"Volume can be measured with water. Pour water into the tank and the bucket. The bucket fits less water than the tank, so its volume is less."
STR_SLIDERS_1_12_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"I hope that all made sense, now you can help us build a rollercoaster!"
STR_SLIDERS_1_12_FERB_1,,,,,,,"But just in case, let's do a quick test!"
STR_SLIDERS_2_01_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Mom! Phineas and Ferb built a rollercoaster! Look!
STR_SLIDERS_2_02_BOYLEFT_1,,,,,,,Wow! Phineas and Ferb built a rollercoaster!
STR_SLIDERS_2_02_BOYRIGHT_1,,,,,,,Let's take the flyer! Maybe we'll get a discount!
STR_SLIDERS_2_03_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,I don't understand! There was a poster just a moment ago!
STR_SLIDERS_2_03_MAMA_1,,,,,,,Stop dreaming and help me with the cart... you have no idea how much it weighs!
STR_SLIDERS_2_03_CANDACE_2,,,,,,,"Hmm... what is ""weight""?"
STR_SLIDERS_2_03_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"Candace! You learned about it in school two years ago, you should know!"
STR_SLIDERS_2_03_CANDACE_3,,,,,,,I guess I forgot. Can you remind me?
STR_SLIDERS_2_04_MAMA_1,,,,,,,Everything has a weight.
STR_SLIDERS_2_04_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Right! A small apple is heavier than a large balloon!
STR_SLIDERS_2_04_MAMA_2,,,,,,,An object may be heavier or lighter than another.
STR_SLIDERS_2_05_MAMA_1,,,,,,,You can compare the weight of two objects by holding them in your hands.
STR_SLIDERS_2_05_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Yeah! This watermelon is much heavier than an apple.
STR_SLIDERS_2_05_MAMA_2,,,,,,,The heavier object will move your hand down harder.
STR_SLIDERS_2_06_MAMA_1,,,,,,,We determine the weight of an object with a scale.
STR_SLIDERS_2_06_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,The needle shows how heavy the object is!
STR_SLIDERS_2_06_MAMA_2,,,,,,,Heavier objects will press harder on the scale.
STR_SLIDERS_2_07_MAMA_1,,,,,,,"The scale measures the weight of the object in a sepcific unit, kilograms."
STR_SLIDERS_2_07_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,I got it! This watermelon weighs 8 kg.
STR_SLIDERS_2_07_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"The dial is divided into equal segments, and if you put an object that weighs one kilogram on the scale, the needle will move exactly one segment."
STR_SLIDERS_2_08_MAMA_1,,,,,,,Objects of equal weight balance each other.
STR_SLIDERS_2_08_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Apparently one liter of water weighs one kilogram.
STR_SLIDERS_2_08_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"Exactly. They press on the scales the same amount, so they balance each other out."
STR_SLIDERS_2_09_MAMA_1,,,,,,,Combining items also adds their weight.
STR_SLIDERS_2_09_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,"Therefore, if the shopping cart has too many items, it will be hard to push it!"
STR_SLIDERS_2_10_MAMA_1,,,,,,,Everything has a temperature.
STR_SLIDERS_2_10_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Some objects are so hot that you can't touch them with your bare hands or you'll get burned.
STR_SLIDERS_2_10_MAMA_2,,,,,,,An object may be warmer or colder or have the same temperature as others.
STR_SLIDERS_2_11_MAMA_1,,,,,,,The temperature of an object may change if it is hot or cold.
STR_SLIDERS_2_11_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,"Yes, yes! If you put ice cream in a bag with hot donuts, it will heat up and melt!"
STR_SLIDERS_2_11_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"And if you put a hot donuts into a box of ice, it will quickly freeze."
STR_SLIDERS_2_12_MAMA_1,,,,,,,We can measure temperature using a thermometer.
STR_SLIDERS_2_12_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,"When the temperature of the object increases, that means that it's warmer. When it falls, it's colder."
STR_SLIDERS_2_12_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"If the bars in the thermometer go up, it means that the temperature is increasing. If they do down, it's decreasing"
STR_SLIDERS_2_13_MAMA_1,,,,,,,The temperature is measured in degrees. It may be below or above zero.
STR_SLIDERS_2_13_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Degrees? That sounds familiar... oh yeah! Ninety degrees is a right angle!
STR_SLIDERS_2_13_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"The thermometer scale is divided into equal segments, each of which is equal to one degree."
STR_SLIDERS_2_14_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,Zero degrees is in the middle. And that means...
STR_SLIDERS_2_14_MAMA_1,,,,,,,Water freezes at zero degrees.
STR_SLIDERS_2_14_MAMA_2,,,,,,,"The freezing point of water is used as a point of reference when measureing temperature. It's a convient solution because water is everywhere on Earth. It's in people, plants, and animals."
STR_SLIDERS_2_15_CANDACE_1,,,,,,,But I saw the poster with my own eyes!
STR_SLIDERS_2_15_MAMA_1,,,,,,,"You should calm down a little... come on, let's go shopping, it's relaxing!"
STR_SLIDERS_3_01_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,Alright! Everything is ready! Time to start the coolest ride ever!
STR_SLIDERS_3_01_FERB_1,,,,,,,Wait! First you have to count all the passengers and cars. Otherwise it won't work!
STR_SLIDERS_3_01_PHINEAS_2,,,,,,,These calculations must be very accurate! The safety of the riders depends of them!
STR_SLIDERS_3_01_FERB_2,,,,,,,First you need to repeat the theory. Just in case.
STR_SLIDERS_3_02_FERB_1,,,,,,,Addition is a mathematical operation that combines two or more numbers into one.
STR_SLIDERS_3_02_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"This operation is marked with a plus sign (+), which is placed between the two numbers being added."
STR_SLIDERS_3_03_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,The sum is written after the equal sign (=).
STR_SLIDERS_3_03_FERB_1,,,,,,,The numbers that we add are called addends and the number that we get as the result is called the sum.
STR_SLIDERS_3_04_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,Addition is like putting things in a basket.
STR_SLIDERS_3_04_FERB_1,,,,,,,Like fruit?
STR_SLIDERS_3_04_PHINEAS_2,,,,,,,"Yes! If you put three apples and three pears in a basket, there will be six fruit."
STR_SLIDERS_3_05_FERB_1,,,,,,,"If you add zero to any number, the sum is the same, that is, the number does not change."
STR_SLIDERS_3_05_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Of course, zero is nothing after all..."
STR_SLIDERS_3_06_FERB_1,,,,,,,There's one more rule in addition: changing the order of the summands doesn't change the sum.
STR_SLIDERS_3_06_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"I understand! When adding numbers, it doesn't matter which we add first."
STR_SLIDERS_3_07_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"This is the opposite of adding! Instead of counting, we subtract."
STR_SLIDERS_3_07_FERB_1,,,,,,,Subtraction is taking away from one number another number which is the same size or smaller.
STR_SLIDERS_3_08_FERB_1,,,,,,,"The number we subtract from is the minuend, the number we subtract is the subtrahend, and the result is the difference."
STR_SLIDERS_3_08_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,Are you trying to mess with my head?
STR_SLIDERS_3_08_FERB_2,,,,,,,"No, it's easy! Minuend is the nubmer which becomes smaller. Subtrahend is the part that's removed from the minuend. And the difference is what's left!"
STR_SLIDERS_3_09_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,And what if we subtract three apples from three cars?
STR_SLIDERS_3_09_FERB_1,,,,,,,Nothing. We can only subtract the same kinds of things from each other.
STR_SLIDERS_3_10_FERB_1,,,,,,,"If you subtract a number from itself, you get zero."
STR_SLIDERS_3_10_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"Yeah... if I have three apples and eat them all, then I'll have nothing left."
STR_SLIDERS_3_11_FERB_1,,,,,,,"And if we subtract zero from any number, it stays the same."
STR_SLIDERS_3_11_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,"You can subtract zero? Sero is nothing, after all."
STR_SLIDERS_3_11_FERB_2,,,,,,,"Exactly! If you subtract zero, nothing will change!"
STR_SLIDERS_3_12_FERB_1,,,,,,,"Alright, now everything is ready for a crazy adventure!"
STR_SLIDERS_3_12_PHINEAS_1,,,,,,,All aboard! Let's go!!!
